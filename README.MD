This repository has code with a quick test of the most efficient settings for `samtools sort` memory per thread and CPUs.

The results were generated to answer a question at https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/18538/samtools-sort-most-efficient-memory-and-thread-settings-for-many-samples-on-a-c

An interactive plot (in the form of an .html page) can be downloaded from
